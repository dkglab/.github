This is the GitHub organization for **INLS 620 Web Information Organization**. It contains the source code repositories for the course assignments, which are managed through GitHub Classroom.

The [course website](https://aeshin.org/teaching/inls-620/) has much more information about the course, including the syllabus and schedule.

We use [Zulip chat](https://inls620.zulipchat.com) to communicate.
